# Python Learning ðŸš€

This repository contains my Python learning journey, organized week by week.  
The goal of this repository is to practice Python concepts step by step and build strong fundamentals for software development.

## ðŸ“… Week 1: Python Basics
- Print statements, input, variables
- Operators and simple programs
- `hello.py` (first Python program)
- `calculator.py` (basic calculator)
- `word_counter.py` (word count program)
- Introduction to GitHub (repo setup, commits, pushes)

## ðŸ“… Week 2: Data Structures & File Handling
- **Data Structures**
  - Lists, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries
  - Dictionary operations (keys, values, items, get, pop)
- **String Handling**
  - Strip, lower, upper, slicing, split, join, replace
- **File Handling**
  - Reading & writing files
  - Safe check with `os.path.exists`
  - Try/Except for missing files
- Practiced creating small programs with file operations

## ðŸ“… Week 3: Exception Handling
- Understanding errors in Python
- `try / except` usage
- Custom exceptions (`NegativeNumberError`)
- Preventing program crashes with error handling

---

## ðŸ“… Week 4: Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)
- Classes & Objects
- Constructors (`__init__`)
- Instance attributes & methods
