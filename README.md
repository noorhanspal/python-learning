# ðŸš€ Python Learning Journey

This repository contains my Python learning journey, organized **week by week**.
The goal of this repository is to practice Python concepts step by step and build strong fundamentals for **software development**.

---

## ðŸ“… Week 1: Python Basics

* Print statements, input, variables
* Operators and simple programs
* `hello.py` â†’ first Python program
* `calculator.py` â†’ basic calculator
* `word_counter.py` â†’ word count program
* Introduction to GitHub (repo setup, commits, pushes)

---

## ðŸ“… Week 2: Data Structures & File Handling

**Data Structures**

* Lists, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries
* Dictionary operations â†’ `keys()`, `values()`, `items()`, `get()`, `pop()`

**String Handling**

* strip, lower, upper, slicing, split, join, replace

**File Handling**

* Reading & writing files
* Safe check with `os.path.exists`
* `try / except` for missing files
* Practice programs with file operations

---

## ðŸ“… Week 3: Exception Handling

* Understanding errors in Python
* `try / except` usage
* Custom exceptions (`NegativeNumberError`)
* Preventing program crashes with error handling

---

## ðŸ“… Week 4: OOP Basics

* Classes & Objects
* Constructors (`__init__`)
* Instance attributes & methods
* Practiced with `Car` class example

---

## ðŸ“… Week 5: OOP â€“ Inheritance, Polymorphism & Encapsulation

**Inheritance**

* Single, Multiple, Multilevel, Hierarchical, Hybrid

**Polymorphism**

* Method Overriding
* Method Overloading (via default args / `*args`)
* Built-in polymorphism â†’ `len()`, `+` operator

**Encapsulation**

* Public, Protected, Private attributes
* Getters & Setters for secure access

ðŸ‘‰ Practice programs created for each concept

---

## ðŸ“… Week 6: Advanced OOP Concepts

**Abstraction**

* Abstract classes & methods (`abc` module)
* Difference between Abstraction & Encapsulation

**`super()` keyword**

* Calling parent constructor & methods in child class

**Method Resolution Order (MRO)**

* `ClassName.mro()` and `__mro__` attribute

**Static & Class Methods**

* `@staticmethod` and `@classmethod`
* Difference from instance methods

**Dunder (Magic) Methods**

* `__str__`, `__len__`, `__add__`
* Used for operator overloading & custom printing

---

## ðŸ“š Mini Project: Library Management System

A project demonstrating **all major OOP concepts**:

* Classes: `Book`, `Library`, `Member`, `Student`, `Teacher`
* Features:

  * Add books to library
  * Register members
  * Borrow & return books

âœ” Showcases **Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Abstraction** in one project

âœ¨ This repository shows my **step-by-step Python learning progress**.
I will keep updating it weekly with **new concepts and projects**.
